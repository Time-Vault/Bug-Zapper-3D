# Bug-Zapper-3D

A little game put together with WebGL and JavaScript

To play, simply download everything and open the HTML file. Click the coloured spheres before they get too big; if 2 circles reach their maximum size you'll lose!

Navigate the sphere by either clicking and dragging, or using the arrow keys.
